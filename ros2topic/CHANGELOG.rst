  * Refactor ros2topic echo verb implementation
  * Move subscription functions into class for easier reuse arguments.

  A new '--filter' option makes it easy to echo only part of a message.
  For example, to only echo the position part of an odometry message:
  ros2 topic echo /odom --filter pose/pose/position
  The filter option takes one value that must not be empty (or only forward slashes '/').
  * Change option name and syntax
  Option is now named '--field' and the '.' character is used as the delimiter.
  Also updated the help message with an example and added a test for accessing a nested field.

  * improve the error message for invalid message types
  * also catch exception for detected message types
* Use reliable QoS for ros2topic tests (`#555 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/555>`_)
  The TestROS2TopicCLI tests perform feature testing of the ros2topic
  command line interface. If the system is under stress during these
  tests, messages may be lost (by design). If that happens, there is a
  fairly high likelihood that the test_topic_pub_once test will fail
  because there is only one opportunity for the message to be successfully
  transported. We're likely dropping other messages in this suite, but the
  other tests continuously publish until one of the messages is received
  (or a timeout occurs), making them significantly less likely to fail.
  Using the 'reliable' setting for QoS reliability seems to make the tests
  consistently pass, even when the system is placed under additional
  stress.

  Issue1: ros2 topic echo pointcould2(big arrays), has no response, updated the logical to make more sensible.
  a. (by default) full_length=false, truncate_length=128, then print max 128 (fix big arrays issue)
  b. pass truncate_length=X, then print max X.
  c. pass full_length=true (whatever truncate_length), then set truncate_length=None and print full_length.
  Issue2: missed truncate_length to _convert_value().
  Since truncate_length is a key argument, pass it explicitly to _convert_value()

  * Make sure to check errors when expanding the topic name.
  We need to catch ValueErrors when actually doing the expansion,
  then InvalidTopicNameException when doing the validation.
  * Switch to using the string from the original exception.
* Support non-absolute topic names. (`#57 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/57>`_)
  * Support non-absolute topic names.
  If the user passes "/topic_name" to the ros2 echo

  to the ros2 echo command, it fails to match.  This
  change just allows us to deal with non-absolute topic
  names.
